          <p>Where to begin? I suppose my computer-boy journey started as a teenager, when I build my own PC so I could run World of Warcraft above 30 FPS on
            the family PC.</p>

          <p>I deepened my admiration for technology by exploring the technical side of the film-making process through camerawork & editing in
            high school. Some people played football, some did theatre, but I... I was a <span [style.font-style]="'italic'">"Film Kid".</span> I wasn't afraid
            to
            take up an on-screen talent role when
            the opportunity presented itself as well, which helped hone my public speaking
            skills from an early age. I was always interested in the technical side of things of whatever hobby I was doing, making my degree choice in Computer
            Science at
            the University of Arkansas (<span [style.color]="'#B44'">Woo Pig! üêó</span>) an easy decision.</p>

          <p>I learned how to code in the pursuit of my degree, never touching an IDE before entering university. I was emphatically hooked after seeing that
            "Hello World" printed to the screen for the first time. Spending hours digging deep on hard problems (fueled by the nectar of the Gods ‚òï) was
            extremely rewarding to me. </p>

          <p>While honing my coding and technical skills, as a sophomore, I began sharing this passion for tech and personal development by becoming an
            <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Engineering Peer Mentor</span>
            and <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Freshman Orientation
              Mentor</span> at the
            university. I also spent a semester as a <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Fulbright IT Classroom Technician</span>, where I learned how to get
            down into the
            nitty-gritty of IT troubleshooting. Throughout all this less-technical work, I was still grinding away in the coding mines and began seeking out
            more computer-science focused opportunities.</p>

          <p>After honing my skills the first half of university, I was humbled to be selected for an
            <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Application Development</span> internship with
            <span [style.color]="'#dbd82a'">J.B. Hunt</span> my
            sophomore year. Following my internship I was offered a full-time position. I quickly moved up the ranks at Hunt from a
            <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Software Engineer I</span>, to a
            <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Software Engineer II</span>, to my current position as a
            <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Software Engineer III</span> and <span [style.color]="'#c78514'">Front-End Technical Lead</span>.</p>
